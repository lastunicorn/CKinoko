CKinoko v1.0
============

There are two projects in the solution at the moment:
	- CKinoko - the framework
	- CKinoko.Example - an example of how the framework can be used.


1) Project: CKinoko
-------------------
Contains the Kinoko function. This function does the measurement and returns the calculated average.


2) Project CKinoko.Example
--------------------------
Contains the main function that calls the Kinoko function. The result is displayed in the console.


3) Future features
------------------
	- Create a console application that can take as parameter a dll and a function name and measure it.
